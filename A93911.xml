            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:169874:25"/>
               <p>The firſt of the three Numbers given, is always 12, which is the ſide of a ſquare foot of Board, or the ſide of a cubicall foot of Timber;</p>

               <p>And let the ſecond line B, be a number of 16, taken from the ſame Scale, and placed from the angle at G unto F, and draw theline FH, and this number of 16 doth ſignifie 16 feet, the length of a ſuppoſed Board.</p>
               <p>And ſo let the third line A, be a number of 18, taken from the ſame Scale and placed from G to I, and this number of 18 doth ſignifie 18 inches; the breadth of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed board: now from the point I, by the fifth Chapter, draw the line IE parallel to FH, till it cutteth EG in E: So have you EG the fourth proportionall line required; which being taken between your Compaſſes, and aplyed to your

               <p>The Firſt number is always 12.</p>
               <p>The Second is always the number of ſquare feet conteined in one of the ſides, I mean, of flat meaſure.</p>
               <p>The Third, is always the number of inches conteined in the thickneſs of the Timber: and this will be always the proportion for this work.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>As 12 is to the length in feet, ſo is the breadth in inches,</item>

               <p>As for example, ſuppoſe the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure A to be a piece of Timber to be meaſured, whoſe length is 8 foot, and breadth 18 inches, and thickneſs 14 inches.</p>

               </figure>
               <p>Now draw two lines, ſo as they may make any angle as the lines BE, and HE, meeting in the angle E, this being done, firſt, place 12 (which is the ſide of a Cubicall foot, of Timber) from E to F, then place 8 (the length of your piece in feet) from E to D, and draw the line DF,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169874:29"/> and then place 18 (the bredth of your piece in inches) from E to H, and then by the 5 Chapter, draw the line HC, parallel to DF, till it cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth BE, in C: So ſhall CE be the number of feet of flat meaſure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the broadeſt ſide of the piece of Timber.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have proceeded ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the laſt Chapter; and now we have three numbers more given us, whereby we may finde a fourth proportionall unto them.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, firſt, we have 12 already placed, from E to F, ſecondly, we have the ſuperficial content of the broadeſt ſide, already placed from E to C: there fore draw the line FC, and thirdly, we have 14 the number of inches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the thickneſs, which we muſt place from E to G: and laſtly, from the point G, by the fifth Chap. draw the line GB parallel to FC, till it cutteth BE at B: So ſhal BE be the number of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:169874:30"/> cubicall feet conteined in that piece of Timber noted with the Letter A, which being taken between your Compaſſes, and applyed unto your Scale, will reach unto 14, and ſo many feet is in that piece.</p>
               <p>Now here I will give you one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of a piece of Timber hewed juſt ſquare: Let the figure B be a piece of Timber ſo hewed, whoſe length is 9 foot.

               <p>And 9 foot the length, from D to A, and draw the line CA, then place 8, the thickneſſe of one of the ſides, from D to F, and by the 5 Chapter, draw the line FE parallel to CA, till it cuteth DA, at E, ſo ſhall ED, be the ſuperficiall content, of one of the ſides, thus far according to the 9th. Chapter, as if it had been a board.</p>

               <p>Let a piece of Timber to be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, be 9 inches broad, and 4 inches thick. Now: becauſe it is not juſt ſquare, it cannot be meaſured by the Table, therefore we muſt finde a mean between the two given ſides, after this manner.</p>

               <p>So that it doth appear, that a piece of Timber that is 9 inches broad, and 4 inches thick, is equall to a piece of 6 inches ſquare.</p>

For in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, joyn 9 and 4 together, and they will make 13, the halfe whereof is 6 and a halfe, which indeed, according to our Rule ſhould be but ſix.</p>

               <p>SUppoſe a piece of Timber be 18 inches broad, and deep 16 inches, it is required to finde how much in length doth make a foot.</p>
               <p>Take twelve the inches in a foot on any Scale of equal parts, &amp; fit that in the breadth eighteen, and take that over in twelve, alwayes. Again, ſet that diſtance in ſixteen the depth, and take it over in twelve ſtill, and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the ſame Scale where the twelve was taken ſhew ſix, and ſo many inches in length make a foot, the thing required.</p>
               <p>Again, let a piece of Timber be broad ſixteen inches, and deep thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:169874:64"/> and a halfe, and it is required to finde how much in length make one foot.</p>
               <p>As before, fit twelve in ſixteen, and take it over in 12 ſtill, &amp; that apply to the ſame Scale where the twelve was taken, ſheweth eight inches, and ſo many inches in length make one foot.</p>
               <p>Again, let a piece of Timber be fifteen three quarters broad, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven three quarters deep: I demand how much ſhall make a foot?</p>
               <p>Bring fifteen three quarters, and twelve into quarters, makes ſixty three, and forty eight, then take twelve on ſome Scale of equall parts, and fit it in ſixty three, and take it over in 48, and that diſtance fit in eleven one quarter, and take it over in 12: Or as before, bring eleven one quarter, and twelve both into quarters, makes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight and forty five, then fit it in forty five, and take it over in forty
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169874:64"/> eight, and that applyed to the ſame Scale where the firſt twelve was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſheweth nine foure fifths, and ſo many inches in length will make one foot.</p>
               <p>If a piece of Timber be ſeven one quarter broad, and five &amp; a half deep, it is required to finde how much in length ſhall make a foot.</p>
               <p>Bring ſeven one quarter, and five an a half into quarters, makes twenty nine, eight hundred twenty two, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe twelve makes 48, then take twelve on any Scale of equall parts, and fit it on twenty nine, and take it over in forty eight, which diſtance fit again in twenty two, and take it over in forty eight, and that applyed to the ſame Scale where the twelve was taken, ſheweth forty three one third part, and ſo many inches in length make a foot, which was required to be done.</p>
